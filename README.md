## Overview

Skytap on Azure provides a unique capability for running IBM Power and x86 workloads in the cloud, enabling lift-and-shift migrations without the need to modify the applications or architectures significantly. Skytap Landing Zones are pre-configured environments that follow best practices and guidelines to optimize the deployment of these workloads on Azure.

### Key Components of a Skytap Landing Zone

1. **Pre-configured Infrastructure**:
   - Includes all necessary virtual network settings, storage configurations, and computing resources needed to perform the migration of AIX or IBM i. This setup is tailored to meet the security, compliance, and operational requirements of the applications being migrated.

2. **Security and Compliance**:
   - Built with security controls and compliance guidelines in mind to ensure that the migrated applications adhere to organizational policies and regulatory standards.

3. **Connectivity**:
   - Ensures robust connectivity options, including VPNs and ExpressRoute connections, for secure and reliable communication between the Skytap environment and on-premises data centers or other cloud services.

4. **Scalability and Flexibility**:
   - Designed to be scalable and flexible to accommodate growth and changes in the workload requirements. This includes scalable storage options and dynamic allocation of computing resources.

5. **Automation and Orchestration**:
   - Incorporates automation tools and scripts to streamline the deployment, management, and scaling of applications. This might involve using Skytap APIs for automation and integration with existing CI/CD pipelines.

6. **Monitoring and Management Tools**:
   - Equipped with monitoring and management tools to provide visibility into application performance and resource utilization, facilitating proactive management and optimization.

### Purpose of a Skytap Landing Zone

- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces the risk associated with cloud migrations by providing a controlled and secure environment to deploy applications.
- **Accelerate Migration**: Speeds up the migration process by offering a ready-to-use environment that reduces the setup time and complexity involved in configuring cloud resources from scratch.
- **Best Practices Integration**: Integrates best practices for cloud deployment, management, and security, ensuring a robust and efficient cloud environment.
- **Consistency and Standardization**: Provides a standardized approach to deploying workloads in the cloud, ensuring consistency across various projects and teams within an organization.

Skytap Landing Zones are part of a strategic approach to cloud adoption, ensuring that organizations can leverage the full benefits of the cloud while addressing the challenges of migration and ongoing cloud management effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with Skytap Landing Zones, follow the steps below:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - An active Azure subscription.
   - A basic understanding of Skytap and its functionalities.
   - Basic knowledge of Azure services like VNets, Blob Storage, and ExpressRoute.

2. **Select a Landing Zone (IBMi or AIX)**:
