## Overview

**Skytap on Azure** provides a unique solution for running IBM Power and x86 workloads in the cloud, enabling lift-and-shift migrations without the need to modify the applications or architectures significantly. Skytap Landing Zones are pre-configured environments that follow best practices and guidelines to optimize the deployment of these workloads on Azure.

### Key Components of a Skytap Landing Zone

1. **Pre-configured Infrastructure**:
   - Includes necessary virtual network settings, storage configurations, and computing resources tailored to security, compliance, and operational requirements.

2. **Security and Compliance**:
   - Built with security controls and compliance guidelines in mind to ensure that the migrated applications adhere to organizational policies and regulatory standards.

3. **Connectivity**:
   - Ensures robust connectivity options, including VPNs and ExpressRoute connections, for secure and reliable communication between the Skytap environment and on-premises data centers or other cloud services.

4. **Scalability and Flexibility**:
   - Designed to be scalable and flexible to accommodate growth and changes in the workload requirements. This includes scalable storage options and dynamic allocation of computing resources.

5. **Automation and Orchestration**:
   - Incorporates automation tools and scripts to simplify the migration process. This might involve using Bicep Language and Skytap APIs for automation.

### Purpose of a Skytap Landing Zone

- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces the risk associated with cloud migrations by providing a controlled and secure environment to deploy applications.
- **Accelerate Migration**: Speeds up the migration process by offering a ready-to-use environment that reduces the setup time and complexity involved in configuring cloud resources from scratch.
- **Best Practices Integration**: Integrates best practices for cloud deployment, management, and security, ensuring a robust and efficient cloud environment.
- **Consistency and Standardization**: Provides a standardized approach to deploying workloads in the cloud, ensuring consistency across various projects and teams within an organization.

Skytap Landing Zones are part of a strategic approach to cloud adoption, ensuring that organizations can leverage the full benefits of the cloud while addressing the challenges of migration.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to start with Skytap Landing Zones:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - An active Azure subscription.
   - A basic understanding of Skytap and its functionalities.
   - Basic knowledge of Azure services like VNets, Blob Storage, and ExpressRoute.
   - An active Skytap on Azure subscription. You can create one by following these [instructions](https://blog.azinsider.net/deploy-skytap-on-azure-using-bicep-language-to-run-your-ibm-power-workloads-a245e7c3287e?source=friends_link&sk=a863322248b8aba5288da813d569afdc)

2. **Select a Landing Zone (IBMi or AIX)**:
   - Utilize the provided Bicep Language templates and scripts to set up your initial Skytap environment in Azure.
