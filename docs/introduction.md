## Skytap Landing Zones

A Skytap Landing Zone refers to a configured and optimized environment within the Skytap cloud platform that is specifically designed to facilitate the migration and management of workloads from on-premises IBM Power systems to the Azure Cloud. This concept is aligned with best practices for cloud migration, providing a structured approach for enterprises to smoothly transition their applications and services.

### Key Components of a Skytap Landing Zone

1. **Pre-configured Infrastructure**:
   - Includes all necessary virtual network settings, storage configurations, and computing resources. This setup is tailored to meet the security, compliance, and operational requirements of the applications being migrated.

2. **Security and Compliance**:
   - Built with security controls and compliance guidelines in mind to ensure that the migrated applications adhere to organizational policies and regulatory standards.

3. **Connectivity**:
   - Ensures robust connectivity options, including VPNs and ExpressRoute connections, for secure and reliable communication between the Skytap environment and on-premises data centers or other cloud services.

4. **Scalability and Flexibility**:
   - Designed to be scalable and flexible to accommodate growth and changes in the workload requirements. This includes scalable storage options and dynamic allocation of computing resources.

5. **Automation and Orchestration**:
   - Incorporates automation tools and scripts to streamline the deployment, management, and scaling of applications. This might involve using Skytap APIs for automation and integration with existing CI/CD pipelines.

6. **Monitoring and Management Tools**:
   - Equipped with monitoring and management tools to provide visibility into application performance and resource utilization, facilitating proactive management and optimization.

### Purpose of a Skytap Landing Zone

- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces the risk associated with cloud migrations by providing a controlled and secure environment to deploy applications.
- **Accelerate Migration**: Speeds up the migration process by offering a ready-to-use environment that reduces the setup time and complexity involved in configuring cloud resources from scratch.
- **Best Practices Integration**: Integrates best practices for cloud deployment, management, and security, ensuring a robust and efficient cloud environment.
- **Consistency and Standardization**: Provides a standardized approach to deploying workloads in the cloud, ensuring consistency across various projects and teams within an organization.

### Use Cases

- **Application Migration**: Ideal for businesses moving legacy applications from an on-premises data center to the cloud to take advantage of Skytap's virtual IT lab and cloud capabilities.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Acts as a disaster recovery site, enabling businesses to quickly spin up their IT operations in Skytap in the event of an outage or disaster at their primary site.
- **Development and Testing**: Provides a separate, isolated environment for development and testing without impacting production workloads.

Skytap Landing Zones are part of a strategic approach to cloud adoption, ensuring that businesses can leverage the full benefits of the cloud while addressing the challenges of migration and ongoing cloud management effectively.
