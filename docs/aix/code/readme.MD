# Skytap AIX Landing Zone 

The main goal of this Landing Zone is to bootstrap all the components needed to perform the migration of the AIX systems to Skytap on Azure.

### üöÄ Prerequisites: ###

1. Begin by [installing the necessary tooling](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5000671).
2. Create your [Skytap on Azure account ](https://www.skytap.com/blog/creating-a-skytap-on-azure-account-from-the-azure-marketplace/)

### üìù Analysis of the Bicep template: ###

This Bicep creates a set of Azure resources, including a Virtual Network, Virtual Machines, and associated components. Here's a breakdown of the key components and their purpose:

1. **Parameters**. The `main.bicepparam` file defines the below:
   - Define values like location, resource group name, storage account name, and more.
   - Parameters include `newOrExisting`, which determines whether a new or existing storage account is used.
   - The template also includes settings for the virtual machine, such as the admin username, password, DNS label, VM size, and security type.

2. **Resources**. The `main.bicep` file defines the below:
    1. Create a VNet
    2. Create a Subnet Gateway
    3. Create a VNet Gateway with the gateway type set to ExpressRoute
    4. Create the ExR connection
    5. Create a storage account private endpoint
    6. Deploy a VM with AzCopy to move the data

   - **Virtual Network (vnet)**: Creates a virtual network with specified address space.
   - **Subnets**: Defines subnets within the virtual network, including a *GatewaySubnet* and another subnet with an associated network security group.
   - **Local Network Gateway**: Sets up a local network gateway with specified IP address and address space, typically used in hybrid network scenarios.
   - **Public IP (gatewayPublicIP, vmPublicIp)**: Configures public IP addresses for the VPN gateway and the virtual machine.
   - **Virtual Network Gateway (vnetGateway)**: Creates an ExpressRoute Gateway with specified SKU and configuration.
   - **Storage Account**: This Bicep template create a new storage account or it can use an existing storage account.
   - **Private Endpoint**: Configures a private endpoint for secure access to the storage account.
   - **Network Security Group**: Sets security rules for network traffic control.
   - **Network Interface (nic)**: Configures the network interface for the virtual machine, including accelerated networking.
   - **Virtual Machine (vm)**: Creates a Windows VM with specified settings, including admin credentials, disk configuration, and security profile (TrustedLaunch if specified).
   - **VM Extension**: Adds a custom script extension to the VM to download and install the AzCopy tool.

3. **Outputs**:
   - `hostname`: The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the VM's public IP.
   - `storageAccountId`: The ID of the storage account, depending on whether a new or existing one is used.

This template sets up a complete environment in Azure to prepare for the AIX migration, including networking, storage, and a virtual machine, with options for secure and managed infrastructure configurations.



### üì¶ Deployment Options: ###

**Option 1. Local Machine Deployment:**

Deploy application samples directly from your local machine using Windows Terminal and Azure PowerShell.

```powershell
$date = Get-Date -Format "MM-dd-yyyy"
$rand = Get-Random -Maximum 1000
$deploymentName = "SkytapDeployment-"+"$date"+"-"+"$rand"

New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -Name $deploymentName -ResourceGroupName skytap-landing-zone -TemplateFile .\main.bicep -TemplateParameterFile .\main.bicepparam -c
```

You can also utilize a Bicep parameters file for added flexibility.

**Option 2. Azure Portal Deployment:**

1. Access the Azure Portal, open CloudShell (using PowerShell), and clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/daveRendon/skytap.git
cd docs/aix/code/
```

2. Once in the working directory of the sample application, execute the following command:

```powershell
$date = Get-Date -Format "MM-dd-yyyy"
$rand = Get-Random -Maximum 1000
$deploymentName = "SkytapDeployment-"+"$date"+"-"+"$rand"

New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -Name $deploymentName -ResourceGroupName skytap-landing-zone -TemplateFile .\main.bicep -TemplateParameterFile .\main.bicepparam -c
```

Once the deployment completes, you can follow the below steps: 

1. **Replicate Data to Azure Blob Storage**: Transfer the mksysb backups to Azure Blob Storage using the JumpboxVM and AzCopy.

1. **Migrate the Mksysb Backups from Blob Storage to Skytap**: Securely copy these files to the Network Installation Management (NIM) server using SCP. (https://winscp.net/download/WinSCP-6.3.4-Setup.exe/download)

1. **Restore Mksysb Files**: Initiate the Mksysb restoration process on the target systems within Skytap.

1. **Add Filesystem to Restored LPARs**: Include necessary temporary space on the restored Logical Partitions (LPARs) for savevg and database files.

1. **Transfer Additional Backup Files (copy savevg and DB files to temporary disk on restore target)**: Copy savevg and database files to the temporary disk space allocated on the restoration targets.

1. **Restore Savevg and Database Files**: Complete the restoration of savevg and database files to ensure all system and application data is accurately reinstated.

1. **Manage and Maintain AIX Environments in Skytap**: Use the NIM server within Skytap to manage and maintain the AIX environments, ensuring optimal performance and efficient operation in their new cloud context.
