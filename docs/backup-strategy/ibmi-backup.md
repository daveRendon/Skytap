## 2. FalconStor StorSafe VTL for IBM i

FalconStor StorSafe is a **certified solution for IBM i in Skytap**. It delivers backup and DR by providing a virtual tape library (VTL) that integrates with BRMS and supports modern and legacy tape workflows.

**Key features:**
- **Patented deduplication & compression**: Up to 95% storage savings.
- **BRMS and tape process compatibility**: Emulates physical tape, supports BRMS/SAVE21/BRMS-ICC/Spectrum Protect, and other software.
- **Cloud-native**: Backs up directly to Azure Blob, block storage, or object storage.
- **Multi-cloud and hybrid**: Replicate backups between on-prem, Skytap, Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud.
- **Disaster recovery**: Full region-to-region DR in Skytap.
- **Single management pane**: StorSight console for all environments.
- **Non-disruptive**: Reuse current backup apps and tape processes.
- **Secure**: Encryption at-rest and in-flight.

**Use cases:**
- On-premise backup optimization and DR.
- Hybrid cloud backup: Deduplicate and copy on-prem IBM i backups to Skytap.
- Migration: Move workloads and tape data to Skytap/Azure.
- Skytap-resident backup: Cloud-native backup and long-term retention for IBM i workloads.
- Skytap disaster recovery: Region-to-region replication for DR and ransomware protection.

## 3. MIMIX for IBM i

[MIMIX for IBM i](https://help.skytap.com/pwr-mimix-overview.html) is a leading **real-time logical replication and HA/DR solution** for IBM i, fully supported in Skytap.

**Key features:**
- **Continuous, real-time replication** at the object or journaled level (minimal RPO/RTO).
- **Automated failover/failback**, planned or unplanned.
- **Supports both OS and user data** (delta sync for production LPARs).
- **Delta sync to NFS or cloud for DR/backup scenarios**.
- **Full support for Skytap-to-Skytap, on-prem-to-Skytap, and multi-cloud** architectures.
- **Integrated monitoring, role swap, and scripting for managed DR**.

## 4. Commvault for IBM i

Commvault delivers multi-platform backup and restore with advanced deduplication and compression, and supports sending data to cloud targets.  
**Note:** No direct BRMS integration—often paired with other tools for granular IBM i backup.

## 5. Skytap Live Clone

- Clone a running IBM i VM/environment in Skytap with a few clicks.
- No additional cost (except storage).
- **Limitation:** Recovery point is last clone operation (not continuous).

---

## 6. BRMS + ICC

- **BRMS integration**: Leverage Skytap-included BRMS licensing for IBM i.
- **Best for small VMs** or for use with incremental capacity cards.
- **Limitation:** Requires extra VM space for temporary backup images.

---

## 7. High Availability and DR Patterns

- **Live Clone**: Simple VM copy for rapid recovery (RPO = last clone).
- **Logical Replication (MIMIX)**: Continuous, low-RPO HA and DR.
- **Geo-Mirroring**: IASP-based replication for lower data change rates.

## 8. Reference Architectures

**A. On-premises → Skytap over VPN or ExR**  
- Use VPN or ExpressRoute Global Reach for secure connectivity between your datacenter and Skytap.
- Backup/replication can be routed over this private link.
- [Skytap VPN Setup](https://help.skytap.com/wan-create-vpn.html)  
- [ExpressRoute Setup](https://help.skytap.com/wan-create-self-managed-expressroute.html)

**B. Skytap to Skytap (DR)**  
- Leverage region-to-region replication with FalconStor or MIMIX for robust DR, ransomware protection, and regulatory compliance.

**C. Hybrid Cloud**  
- Use FalconStor or Commvault to deduplicate and send IBM i backup data to Skytap or Azure Blob for long-term retention and recovery.
